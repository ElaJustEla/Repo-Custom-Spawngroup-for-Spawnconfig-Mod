# Repo-Custom-Spawngroup-for-Spawnconfig-Mod
Notice:
Due to current limitations, events capped with levels will not function properly beyond level 9999.

Warning for New Players:
This script is not recommended for beginners. It assumes the player is experienced enough to handle all enemies with at least 13 Strength and a Stun Gun or similar Items.

Modification:
1. Adjusted enemy spawn rates.
2. Added 3 new Challenge Events.
3. Introduce 9 Events.

Global Changes:
1. If an enemy type is selected, up to three instances of that entity group will spawn.
2. From level 11 onwards:
   1. All enemies are guaranteed to appear in each level.
   2. Each Spawn rate may be tripled, in addition to the global rule above.

As a result, a single enemy group (e.g. One Bowtie, or A pack of 4 Gnomes) can multiply up to 6 groups total.

However, once a Challenge Event/ Event is triggered, no other enemy types will spawn beyond the event specifications.

All Challenge Events will have a chance to trigger from level 12.

Challenge Events:
1. Solar Eclipse:
   Doubles the spawn count for all Monster Level 3 enemies.
   50% Chance to double the spawn density.
   In conclusion, up to 4 instances of the same Level 3 entity may spawn.
2. Blood Moon:
   Spawns all enemy types, then doubles their spawn count.
   33% chance for the spawn rate to double again.
   Hence, All enemies may appear up to 4 time each.
3. Full Moon:
   Spawns all Monster Level 2 enemies and triples their count.
   An additional chance to triple again.
   Hence, Level 2 enemies may spawn up to 6 instances per group.

All Events are available from all levels.

Events:
1. Lunar Eclipse (available from Level 9):
   Spawns the following Monster Level 1 enemies:
   1. 5 Peepers
   2. 2 Shadow Child
   3. 8 Gnomes
   4. 5 Ducks
   5. 3 Spewers
   50% chance to double spawn density.
   So, all listed enemies will spawn accordingly, potentially at double rates.
2. Beholder:
   Spawn 15 Peepers.
   50% chance to double the count.
3. Yippee Day:
   Spawn 10 Ducks.
   Spawn rate may be tripled.
4. Chef's Choice:
   Spawn 10 Chefs.
5. Rumbling:
   Spawn 10 Bowties.
6. Basketball:
   Spawn 10 Upscreams.
7. Space:
   Spawn 10 Trudges.
8. Relay Race:
   Spawn 10 Hiddens.
